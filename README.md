# cse471-project2
Repo for 471 Project 2

To create the video, start the program and then select `Frames->Write Then Create Remaning`.

The output video should then be placed in the root of the project, under the name `final.asf`.

The implementation details for each feature is placed in the grading document.
I have used a video editor, KDENLive, to combine the green screen video and video of myself.
I have also used this editor to add the soundtrack.
